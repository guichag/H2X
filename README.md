Exploring Humid Heat Extremes in the global Tropics
Using the convection-permitting (CP) version of the UK Met Office NWP model (see https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-17-0503.1)

Workflow:
Wet-bulb temperature extremes identified with a 3D connected-components algorithm (https://pypi.org/project/connected-components-3d/)
Composite analysis of environmental conditions associated with Twb extremes on a 4x4 deg.-6 days window
