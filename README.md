Exploring Humid Heat Extremes in the global (sub)Tropics: https://gotw.nerc.ac.uk/list_full.asp?pcode=NE%2FX013596%2F1&cookieConsent=A

Using the convection-permitting (CP) version of the UK Met Office NWP model (see https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-17-0503.1)


Workflow:

Wet-bulb temperature extremes identified with a 3D connected-components algorithm (https://pypi.org/project/connected-components-3d/)

Composite analysis of environmental conditions associated with Twb extremes on a 4x4 deg.-6 days window
